# Iguana

Iguana is an open-source, Python-based network analysis suite designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts, network administrators, and educational purposes. This tool integrates functionalities for network scanning, port scanning, packet sniffing, and DNS information gathering, offering a streamlined approach to network diagnostics and security auditing.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Discover active devices within a specified IP range.
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports on devices and assess network security.
- **Network Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network traffic.
- **DNS Gathering**: Retrieve DNS records associated with a domain.
```
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uveissmjl/Iguana.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Iguana
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy dnspython
   ```
4. Make the script executable (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x iguana.py
   ```

## Usage

Below are examples of how to use each feature of Iguana:

- **Network Scanning**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./iguana.py -m scan --ip 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
- **Port Scanning**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./iguana.py -m port-scan --ip 192.168.1.1
  ```
- **Network Sniffing**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./iguana.py -m sniff --interface eth0
  ```
- **DNS Gathering**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./iguana.py -m dns-gather --domain example.com
  ```

Replace parameters like `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.1.1`, `eth0`, and `example.com` with your target information.

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is intended for legal and ethical use only. Unauthorized scanning and probing of networks may be illegal and unethical. Users are responsible for their actions and should ensure they have permission before engaging in any network scanning activities.
